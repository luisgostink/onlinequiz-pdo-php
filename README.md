# onlinequiz-php-pdo

# Project context:
You want to learn trivial facts about geography, biology, zoology, languages etc. with the help of an Online Quiz.

# Learning methods:
You work solo as Web Developer and with Trainer guidance. Build the following pages (please, not everything in one single page):


# Start/Home page index.php that introduces the Trivia Quiz and allows to select a topic and then start the Quiz with 12 to 15 questions
# The question.php page (question text, instruction, answer-1, answer-2 etc.) completely filled from database
# report.php page

# Plan and implement navigation buttons for simple use and testing.
# Plan, organize and build the website, using HTML, CSS, Bootstrap 5, PHP, PDO, phpMySQL and JavaScript. Then use VS Code, Docker, Git/GitHub for developing and source control. Use Figma for the Mockup.

# See the output of your project as a prototype development - a perfect or fancy layout is secondary :-)
# Finish your project at 12:30 of the 24th August. If possible, we will organize a vernissage of the quizzes.
